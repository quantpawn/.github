## 🙋‍♀️ Introduction
In the past, quantitative trading heavily relied on experts or statistical mathematicians to analyze the market, discover trading strategies, and apply them for profit. An effective strategy could take years from discovery to practical deployment.

We believe that the advancement of AI, especially the new generation of intelligence represented by Generative AI, fundamentally changes this structure. The inherent reasoning capabilities empower AI with the potential for self-reflection and self-iteration. AI can autonomously analyze data, search for alpha factors, and apply them optimally through feature engineering for trading. Even starting with the equivalent of an 8-year-old's intelligence, given sufficient compute resources for iteration, it can eventually beat the best human traders. Concurrently, the real-time and automated nature of AI dramatically surpasses human imagination in terms of discovery and iteration efficiency.

This is the foundation of our work: rethinking and redefining the next generation of trading systems from the perspective of AI.


## 🧙 Our Core Beliefs
- **Data Over Intuition**: We do not rely on human intuition or experience; we trust only conclusions that are mathematically and statistically verifiable.
- **AI Supremacy**: We believe AI will ultimately replace human traders. We are confident that within the current Generative AI framework, there is already the potential for mature trading intelligence in specific scenarios, and this is what we are building.
- **Compute is Key**: Compute power is the ultimate driver that will make this future a reality.

Given our belief that AI far surpasses human capabilities, our expectation for an AI trading system is no longer the traditional annual percentage returns. Instead, our aggressive target is an average profit of 1% per day (1% DPR). This is why we called ourselves as "1% Project".

This ambitious goal constantly drives our exploration and innovation.
